# Project Outline

[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Overview
My project will create a client and web-API for a set of data from a collection of (sample) healthcare documents.  The client will be a research tool geared toward health-care researchers and administrators.

### Features
- Searching and filtering: the MVP will focus on languages spoken by health-care recipients.
- Dynamic mapping: the MVP will focus on the distances health-care recipients live from their hospitals.
- Data export: the MVP will allow users to export the results of their queries.


### Technologies
- Python for generating randomized sample data
- ASP.NET REST API
- Leaflet JavaScript (or Google Maps... tbd)
- html+css or Bootstrap
- MySQL Database
- ASP.NET or Angular front-end for consuming the API

### What I'll Have to Learn
Leaflet.js or Google Maps API
ASP.NET REST API
Consuming a web-API with ASP.NET or Angular
