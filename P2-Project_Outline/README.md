# Project Outline

## Assignment Description
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Submission Instructions
(TBA)

## Overview
My project will make a set of data available from a collection of (sample) healthcare documents for healthcare administrators and researchers.  In order to stay manageable, the proof-of-concept will begin with patient location data (zip codes), language data, and hospital affiliations, as well as location data for hospitals.  The sample documents and data will be randomly generated.  This means it will not accurately reflect realistic healthcare scenarios, but the documents will conform with the widely used CDA/XML healthcare standard, which means that one could conceivably swap real-life CDA documents into the system without making any other changes to the app.

### Features
- Searching and filtering
- Dynamic mapping
- Adding new data
- Simple validation
- (Later stage) Editing and amending the CDA/XML records directly


### Technologies
- XML and XQuery
- Javascript or Python for generating randomized sample data
- ASP.NET MVC
- Leaflet JavaScript (or Google Maps... tbd)
- html+css or Bootstrap
- Database (probably MySQL but maybe BaseX if I can find resources for connecting that with ASP.NET)

### What I'll Have to Learn
Leaflet.js or Google Maps API
ASP.NET MVC (more practice)
Connecting ASP.NET to an XML database (if I go with BaseX)

### Project Tracker
TBA
